# Variables in RUBY 
# Very simple and similar to the bash format 

hello = "Hello world!"

# Things to note: 
## Ruby variables prefer the snake_case naming vs JS camelCase
## Interpolation is #{} not ${} 

# A Ruby variable cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.

# To reassign a variable, you simply restate the variable. 
hello = "Hello world"
hello = "I changed this"

10.times do 
  puts "this text"
end
